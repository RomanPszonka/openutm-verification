## Dummy OAUTH Infrastructure

To enable local development, we use a Dummy OAUTH server that produces valid ASTM standards compliant JWT tokens without a server, this is meant for local development only and for production a "real" OAUTH server like [Flight Passport](https://www.github.com/utmalliance/flight-passport) or others is recommended. This code is from the [InterUSS DSS](https://github.com/interuss/dss/tree/master/cmds/dummy-oauth) repository.
